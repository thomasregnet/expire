Feature: Simple Format
  In order to see the porogress of purging
  as an user
  I want to watch the output with a simple format

  # Delete this feature?
  # purge without rules may not be a good idea.
  # Scenario: Purge with no special parameter
  #   Given the backup directory exists
  #   When I run `expire purge backups`
  #   Then the output should contain "keeping"
  #   And the output should contain "purged"
